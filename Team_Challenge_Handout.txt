Mini Software Team Challenge - Student Handout
Objective
Work as a team to apply real-world software development practices including version control, IDE use, CI/CD concepts, and distributed computing.
Instructions
• Form groups of 3–4 students.
• Create a Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, or local).
• Assign roles: Developer A, Developer B, Reviewer, Tester.
• Each group member must create at least one branch and merge it using meaningful commit messages.
• Develop a simple program (e.g., calculator, greeting app, to‑do list).
• Choose an IDE: VS Code, IntelliJ IDEA, or Eclipse, and explain your choice.
• Describe how CI/CD would apply to your project (no need to implement).
• Choose a distributed computing paradigm (RPC, Message Queue, or Publish‑Subscribe) and explain how your project could scale using it.
Deliverables
• Git repository link or uploaded zip file
• 2–3 minute demo presentation
• One reflection slide explaining CI/CD and distributed computing
